<span class="doccomment">//! Resolver Architecture Documentation</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! &lt;i&gt;This module does not contain any code. It is intended for more</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! detailed documentation of the resolver. Currently, that is limited to</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! a short introduction to its architecture.&lt;/i&gt;</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! # What’s in a Resolver?</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Roughly speaking, the task of a resolver is to answer a question using</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! information stored in the DNS. We shall call this question a *lookup.*</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! There is different lookups for different questions. For example, finding</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! all IP addresses for a given hostname is such a lookup. Finding the IP</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! addresses of the mail server for a given domain is another, somewhat more</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! complex lookup.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! DNS is a relatively simple key-value store: All information is keyed by</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! a tripel of a domain name, a record type, and a class. The values are a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! set of binary strings who will be interpreted according to rules defined</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! for each record type. One such entry is called a *resource record set,*</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! commonly shortened to *RRset.*</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Most lookups will require information from more than one such RRset.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! For example, there are two types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! addresses. Each type has its own record type, so there are two RRsets</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to consider when determining all addresses assigned to a host.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! In this case, the two RRsets can be looked up in parallel. In case of the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! mail server lookup, we first need to determine the host name of the mail</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! server responsible for the domain. There is a record type and hence a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! RRset for this purpose. Once we have that, we can look up the IP addresses</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! for that host in parallel.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! In other words, a lookup performs a series of steps each consisting of</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! asking the DNS for one or more RRsets in parallel.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Such a request for a specific RRset is called a *query.* Since DNS is a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! distributed system, the first step of a query would be finding out where</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! exactly the RRset is stored. However, we are implementing a stub resolver</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! which is configured with a set of DNS servers that do this hunt for it.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The stub resolver simply asks those configured servers for the RRset and</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! if they all fail to find it, it fails too.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Since DNS prefers to use the unreliable UDP as transport protocol, the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! typical strategy is to ask the first server on the list and wait for a</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! bit. If no answer arrives, ask the second server and wait again. If all</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! servers have been asked and none has answered in due time, repeat the</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! process for a number of times and finally fail. Alternatives are to start</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! with a different server every time or to ask all servers at once.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Under some circumstances, the resolver can also fall back to using TCP</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! instead. Plus, there is an effort underway to encrypt the DNS connections.</span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! Which all is to say that a query may have to ask different servers for an</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! RRset, potentially using different transport protocols. For our own</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! purposes, we shall henceforth call the process of asking one specific</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! server over one specific transport protocol a *request.* </span>
<span class="doccomment">//!</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! The *resolver,* finally, collects all information necessary to be able</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! to perform queries. It knows which servers to use with which protocols</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! and has additional configuration information that is used to perform</span>
<span class="doccomment">//! queries.</span>
